		\item Problem 1
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item This is the probability of choosing a coin in category 1 and getting heads plus choosing a coin in category 2 and getting heads plus choosing a coin in category 3 and getting heads, which translates to:
				$$P(F=H) = \bigg(\frac{1}{5} * 0.2\bigg) + \bigg(\frac{2}{5} * 0.3\bigg) + \bigg(\frac{2}{5} * 0.9\bigg) = 0.52$$
				
				\item \textbf{come back}
				
				\item \textbf{come back} Assuming $C$ is the category and $F$ represents the flip (Either $H$ or $T$) then we are asked to find $P(C=1 | F=H), P(C=2 | F=H), P(C=3 | F=H)$.  The overall formula for any category $c$ is:
				$$P(C=c | F=H) = \frac{P(F=H | C=c) * P(C=c)}{P(F=H)}$$
				
				The denominator is calculated in (a), $P(C=c)$ is simply the number of coins in category $c$ divided by 5, and $P(F=H | C=c)$ is given in the problem prompt, so we have:
				
				$P(C=1 | F=H) = \frac{\frac{1}{5} * 0.2}{0.52} = 0.077$\\
				$P(C=2 | F=H) = \frac{\frac{2}{5} * 0.3}{0.52} = 0.230$\\
				$P(C=3 | F=H) = \frac{\frac{2}{5} * 0.9}{0.52} = 0.692$\\
				
				\item \textbf{come back}
				
				\item The probability of getting heads is part (a) of this assignment, which is $0.52$.  This means it's a little over a 50/50 chance that you will get heads.  If you bet heads, the expected payout is $E(X) = (0.52 * 10) + (0.48 * -10) = 0.4$.  This means on average over a large number of plays, we expect a payout of $\$0.40$, so you should bet Heads and expect to win $40$ cents over the long term.
